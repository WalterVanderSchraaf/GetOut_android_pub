# GetOut_android_pub

This is the code base for an Android app "GetOut" which is a "Swiss Army" knife app I am slowly developing.  
It collects notes which have many features: e.g. dictionary lookups for my son's vocabulary tests, takes pictures, shares via txt/email etc, shopping lists, 
creation of calendar events and notifications that can trigger txt msgs or emails
It can record running, walking, biking routes using geolocations and google fitness information.
It stores everything in a small sqlite db.  Various information can be uploaded to AWS buckets which can trigger lambdas that can update RDS dbs.
